  <p>

    Clairo rose to prominence following the viral success of the music video for her lo-fi single "Pretty Girl" in 2017. She subsequently signed a record deal, releasing her debut EP Diary 001 (2018) with Fader Label. Her debut studio album Immunity (2019) spawned the singles "Bags" and "Sofia", the latter of which became her first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100.

  <h3>Life and Career</h3>
  <p1>
    Claire Cottrill was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in Carlisle, Massachusetts. She is the daughter of marketing executive Geoff Cottrill and Allie Cottrill, a photographer and designer.
  </p1>
  <h3>2011-2016: Early Career</h3>
  <p2>
    Cottrill began recording covers on her MacBook at the age of 13, beginning with a cover of a Maroon 5 song. In a 2015 interview with Rookie, she recalled of this first recording, "It took me hours to figure out if I wanted to post it on Facebook or not to even tell my friends that I'd made it. I was so nervous about it! I just closed my eyes and did it, and then I closed my computer and tried not to think about it". She would also perform covers at local businesses including Blue Dry Goods. During this time, MTV contacted her to record a song to be used as background music for one of their shows, but the song was never used. She began posting music to Bandcamp under the names Clairo and DJ Baby Benz while attending Concord-Carlisle High School. She went on to post covers and songs in addition to DJ mixes of rap music on SoundCloud. She also posted three short films on an old YouTube channel, and maintained a second one where she would post covers in addition to short films. She launched her EP Do U Wanna Fall in Love? in 2013 after releasing several home recordings. A few additional EPs, including Aquarius Boy, Late Show, Moth Girl, Metal Heart, and Have a Nice Day, came after this in 2015.

  <h3>2017-2018: Diary 001 EP</h3>
  <p3>
    Clairo first drew wide attention in late 2017 when the video for her song "Pretty Girl" went viral on YouTube. The
    song was recorded for an indie rock compilation benefiting the Transgender Law Center. According to her,
  </p3>
  <p3> she recorded the track "using the surrounding resources which were pretty shitty. I used like a little keyboard
    that I had, and I was really into '80s pop music – my mom is obsessed with it – so it kind of inspired me to do
    something like that." She has attributed audience interest in the video to YouTube's algorithm system. The video was
    quickly lumped into the growing genre of bedroom pop, and also became popular on vaporwave-centric Facebook groups.
    "Pretty Girl" had amassed more than 110 million views on YouTube by 2024. Another video, "Flaming Hot Cheetos", was
    released a month before "Pretty Girl" on YouTube. It garnered 3 million views by July 2018. The success of "Pretty
    Girl" led to interest from major labels such as Capitol, RCA, and Columbia. Jon Cohen, the co-founder of The Fader,
    signed Clairo to the magazine's associated record label with a 12-song record contract and introduced her to Pat
    Corcoran, manager of Chance the Rapper. She became a client of talent agency Haight Brand near the end of 2017. On
    May 25, 2018, Fader Label released Clairo's debut record, titled Diary 001. In her review for Pitchfork, Fader
    contributor Sasha Geffen wrote that the EP ought to subside the "legions of naysayers who dismissed her as a one-hit
    fluke or an industry plant." A piece written by Joe Coscarelli of The New York Times said that the EP "bridges both
    worlds, building on the coy, understated bedroom pop of 'Pretty Girl' and 'Flaming Hot Cheetos' toward sturdier
    numbers like '4EVER' and 'B.O.M.D.'" Also in May, Clairo announced a headlining tour throughout North America, as
    well as select dates opening for Dua Lipa. Her July performance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York was a sold-out
    show. In August 2018, she performed at Lollapalooza. She performed at Coachella in 2019.
  </p3>
  <h3>2019-2020: Immunity</h3>
  <p4>
    On May 24, 2019, Clairo released a new single, "Bags", and announced her debut studio album Immunity, which was released on August 2, 2019. She would further release two more singles from the album, "Closer to You" and "Sofia". Following the album's commercial success, Apple Music named Clairo an Up Next artist in August 2019.
    Clairo made her television debut performing "I Wouldn't Ask You" on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in September 2019, before performing "Bags" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show a few days later. In December 2019, she won Pop Artist of the Year at the 2019 Boston Music Awards for the second consecutive year, as well as Album of the Year for Immunity. "Bags" was included in over 15 critics' lists ranking the year's top songs including Pitchfork's and Paste's lists of the best songs of the decade. Immunity was included in over 10 critics' end of year lists, including The Guardian, Pitchfork, Billboard and Los Angeles Times. As of 2019, Clairo was managed by Mike Ahern and Jimmy Bui.
  </p4>
  <h3>2020-2023: Sling</h3>
  <p5>
    In April 2020, Clairo revealed that she had begun working on her second studio album via a tweet of a screenshot of a playlist titled "Album 2 (demos so far)". In October of that same year, she formed a new band called Shelly with indie pop artist Claud and their two friends from Syracuse University, Josh Mehling and Noa Frances Getzug.[43] The group released two songs, "Steeeam" and "Natural", on October 30, 2020.
    Clairo at the Sling sessions, 2021. On June 11, 2021, Clairo released "Blouse", the first single from her second studio album, Sling, which was announced that same day. The record is for Cottrill, but it is also a record of her attempts to reevaluate her goals in life, bearing the Laurel Canyon imprint and replaces Immunity's sparse electronic flourishes with lush, acoustic folk frequently adorned with swooning vocal harmonies, delicate strings, and the warm swell of brass. It was released on July 16, 2021, and was praised for Clairo's artistic progression and thematic songwriting that ponders future motherhood, domesticity and the responsibility of becoming a caregiver. It also appeared on numerous "best albums of 2021" lists.
    In February 2022, Clairo embarked on the US leg of the Sling tour. She canceled the last three dates of her North American tour, after a technical incident at her gig in Toronto left her with temporary hearing damage. After two songs, her opening show of the UK tour in Bristol had to be canceled due to a case of sinusitis that was affecting her voice, leading to her having a panic attack onstage and leaving afterward. The Glasgow show was canceled but the show the day after it in Manchester went ahead, and her final UK show of that tour was in London.
    In 2023, the singer appeared as an opening act for Boygenius during the inaugural Re:SET Concert Series. In May, after being featured on remixes by Phoenix and Beabadoobee, she released the EP Live at Electric Lady, containing new versions of songs from her first two albums.[58] She also released two charity singles on Bandcamp, "For Now" with all proceeds directed to Everytown for Gun Safety and For The Gworls, and "Lavender" to raise funds for Doctors Without Borders during the Israel–Hamas war.

  <h3>2020-Present: Charm</h3>
  <p6>
    In January 2024, Clairo teased a new album with a post on Instagram, captioning it "maybe this year". In March, she shared an Instagram post captioned with emojis depicting the number three, a check mark, and a purple heart. On May 23, Clairo announced her third album, titled Charm, which she co-produced with Leon Michels. Its lead single, "Sexy to Someone" was released concurrently. On May 29, she performed at two residencies to support the album in New York and Los Angeles in September 2024. On June 28, "Nomad" was released as the record's second and last single.
    Charm was released on July 12, 2024, to critical acclaim, with music critics highlighting the record's jazz-like production, songwriting and Clairo's overall musical expansion. On July 18, 2024, to promote the record, Clairo performed "Juna", the seventh track of the album, live at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. On the same day, she also announced the dates of her 2024 North American tour spanning between September to November. The tour was supported by singer-songwriter Alice Phoebe Lou as the opening act.
    On August 4, the music video for "Juna" was released. It marked Clairo's first music video in six years, and it is wrestling-themed. The next day, she released a cover of Lana Del Rey's "Brooklyn Baby" exclusively on Spotify as part of the Spotify Singles series. On October 9, Clairo released a cover of singer-songwriter Margo Guryan's "Love Songs". The cover song is a part of the Guryan tribute compilation album Like Someone I Know, released on November 8, 2024. Simultaneously, Charm was nominated in the Best Alternative Music Album category of the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. This marked Clairo's first Grammy nomination. On December 3, she shared the music video for "Sexy to Somebody".
